## True Creative Artificial Intelligence

This project aims at enabling Artificial Intelligence to be creative to solve complex problems such as the ones related to agent control.

## Neural Models

It is composed by Neural Networks models and Processes created and developed by me. Some of the proposals are based on Adaptive Neural Networks and others on Deep Learning ones. New models are added every week.

### Adaptive Resonance Associative Map

The first model, here uploaded, is an improved version of the Adaptive Resonance Associative Map (ARAM), created by Ah We Than, and it incorporates a new composite operation called proximity metric developed by me.

This neural network is based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory and can be used to control agents in real-time without costing too much processing power of your hardware.
